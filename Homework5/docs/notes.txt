1.	Set Up the Core Model:
•	Define your basic classes (Card, Cell, Board, Player, and Position if needed).
•	Implement a basic RulesKeeper that enforces the current move rules. Initially, this could simply verify that the right cell is chosen and that the move meets pawn requirements.
2.	Abstract Influence Effects:
•	Define an InfluenceEffect interface with an apply(Cell, Player) method.
•	Have your Card class delegate influence logic to one or more implementations of this interface. This makes it easier to extend influence effects later.
3.	Separate Player Interfaces:
•	Start with a simple Player class in the model.
•	Document (or stub out) a separate “user-player” interface in your design document to explain how human or AI players will later interact with your model.
4.	Build and Test Incrementally:
•	Begin with reading the deck file (using DeckReader).
•	Initialize a board and add the initial pawn placements.
•	Test the rules enforcement using your RulesKeeper.
•	Develop your textual view to print the board state after each move.
