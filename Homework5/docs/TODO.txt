QUESTIONS

- Do you need to override functions when you implement an interface? Do we need the @Override
    annotation? Make sure everything is consistent.
- If a card of the same name (but maybe different values) is read in, do we store it as a new card
    or do we update the existing card, or do we ignore it?
- Should logic like autopass be in the Controller or Model? What about command line interpretation?
    I am pretty sure that goes in the Controller, but I am not sure about autopass and other things
    like that.
