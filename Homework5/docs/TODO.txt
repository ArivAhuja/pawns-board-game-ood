TODO Items
==========

- Do you read in duplicate cards? If a 'guard' is in twice, do you read it twice or just the first time?
- Confirm that Player A placing a card with influence deosn't affect Player B's influence. E.g. make sure player
A card influence doesn't add to player B card influence baord.
- BUG: When a hand is empty, make sure to pass automatically for the player and not ask them to play a move.
- At the end: Create interfaces for all files (append "I" to file name for simplicity) and make sure all classes implement them.
- TESTING!!!
