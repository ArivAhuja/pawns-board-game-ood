DO NOT SUBMIT UNTIL EVERYTHING HERE IS CHECKED OFF AND WE HAVE BOTH DONE ONE LAST FINAL CODE CHECK.


QUESTIONS

- Do you need to override functions when you implement an interface? Do we need the @Override
    annotation? Make sure everything is consistent.
- If a card of the same name (but maybe different values) is read in, do we store it as a new card
    or do we update the existing card, or do we ignore it?
- Should logic like autopass be in the Controller or Model? What about command line interpretation?
    I am pretty sure that goes in the Controller, but I am not sure about autopass and other things
    like that.


TODO

- Confirm that Player A placing a card with influence deosn't affect Player B's influence.
    E.g. make sure player A card influence doesn't add to player B card influence board.
    Maybe store influence with the player letter to make sure we can differentiate.
- Make sure we have interfaces for everything.
- Document the class invarient that is mentioned in the HW.
- Cleanup all code, comments, indentation, etc before initial submission.
- Write tests for everywhere, mainly MODEL, but also CONTROLLER and VIEW.
- Create the official README.md file.
