/**
 * The {@code ControlBoardStrategy} class implements a strategy for the Pawns Board game
 * that selects the move which maximizes control over the board. It does so by simulating the effect
 * of each legal move on a cloned board and counting the number of cells that would be owned by the
 * current player after applying the move's influence.
 * <p>
 * In case of a tie in the number of controlled cells, the strategy prefers moves that are uppermost
 * (lowest row number), then leftmost (lowest column number), and finally the move that uses a lower
 * card index.
