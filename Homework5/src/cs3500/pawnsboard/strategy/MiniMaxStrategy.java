/**
 * The {@code MiniMaxStrategy} class implements a simple minimax-based strategy for the Pawns Board
 * game.
 * <p>
 * This strategy evaluates each legal move by simulating its effect on a cloned board, applying the
 * card's influence,
 * and then using a heuristic evaluation function. The heuristic used here is defined as:
 * (number of cells owned by the player) - (number of cells owned by the opponent). The move with
 * the highest evaluation
 * is selected. In the event of a tie, the first move in the legal moves list is chosen.
